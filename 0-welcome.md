# Python Data Structure
## Welcome
Welcome to a collection tutorial for coding. With each tutorial, you will learn what the collection does, what makes it unique, the pros and cons of using that collection and so much more! At the end of each lesson, there will be a simple problem to allow the student to practice applying what they just learned about the structure. 

## Data Structures
