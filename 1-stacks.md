# Stacks
## Introduction
A stack is a simple data structure that has the unique attribute of only allowing the user to access the most recently added element, also known as the Last-In-First-Out order. This style of structure allows very cheap access to the last element as well as adding to the stack. However, it also has its drawbacks. The user will no longer have access to any previously added elements until the ones after it have been removed.
